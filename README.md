# So Long

## Disclaimer
This project is a enhanced version of the So Long project, part of the 42 curriculum. Most of the features in this So Long are extras that I made for fun. If you are planning to do this project, you **will not have** to add all the features I added.

Other important point: this project is not a good example of 2D engine. It has been designed to be quick to implement and is not suitable for production or bigger games. Most of the optimisation features are not implemented.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a little 2D game in which a dolphin eats fich and escape Earth. In my case, the dolphin has turned into a magical cat, the fish has turned into croquettes and the Earth is in fact a kitchen infested by mice. In order to eat all the croquettes, the cat can fly to reach the shelves (Using the magic of wifi!). The amount of moves is displayed in the terminal.

## Instructions

Build the mandatory part using
```bash
make
```

and the bonus part with
```bash
make bonus
```

The maps are stored in the `maps` folder.

You can open a map using
```bash
./so_long maps/map0.ber
```
